If fd is 1, 
	dup2(fd, 0); // close 0 and 0 -> 1
	dup2(fd, 1); // do nothing. fd 1 is still open
	dup2(fd, 2); // close 2 and 2 -> 1
	if (fd > 2) close(fd); // do nothing
In the end, we have 3 fds pointing to the same file: 1.

If fd is 3,
	dup2(fd, 0); // close 0 and 0 -> 3
	dup2(fd, 1); // close 1 and 1 -> 3
	dup2(fd, 2); // close 2 and 2 -> 3
	if (fd > 2) close(fd); // close 3
In the end, we have 3 fds pointing to the same file fd 3 was pointing to.
