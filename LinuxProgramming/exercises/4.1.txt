If stat is called, it always tries to follow a symbolic link (Figure 4.17), so the program will never print a file type of "symbolic link." For the example shown in the text, where /dev/cdrom is a symbolic link to cdroms/cdrom0 (which itself is a symbolic link to ../scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/cd), stat reports that /dev/cdrom is a block special file, not a symbolic link. If the symbolic link points to a nonexistent file, stat returns an error.
