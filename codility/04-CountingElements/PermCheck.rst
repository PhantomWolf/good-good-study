Permutation Check
============================================
Check whether array A is a permutation.

描述
-----------------------------------
A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.

A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.

For example, array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2

is a permutation, but array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3

is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.

The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.

Write a function:

    int solution(vector<int> &A);

that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.

For example, given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2

the function should return 1.

Given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3

the function should return 0.

Assume that:

        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.


解答
-----------------------------------
根据描述可知，从1到N，每个数字只出现一次，这才叫一个置换(permutation)。所以我们只要把所有数都存入哈希表，然后探测从1到N的数是否存在于哈希表中即可。若有任何一个数不在哈希表中，那就返回0；否则返回1。
