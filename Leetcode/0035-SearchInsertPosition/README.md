# 35. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4

Example 4:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0

## Solution
- If array is empty, the result is 0
- If array's last element is smaller than target, return its length
- Otherwise, there must be at least one element that's no smaller than target. Use binary search to find it.
