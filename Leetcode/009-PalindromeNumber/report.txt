9 Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

Hints:
Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1) The answer is no.
If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

Solution:
1.Get the first and last digit each turn, and compare them. If they're different, return false immediately.
2.Remove these 2 digits from x.
3.Repeat until x == 0.

Notes:
    while (x/10 >= div) {
        div *= 10;
    }
In above code,
    x/10 >= div
can't be replaced with
    x >= div*10
due to possible integer overflow.
